# RRXX-Mod-Howto
This repository contains a collection of docs explaining how to mod Rumble Roses XX.

All the tools necessary should be available from other repositories under this account. These are all just copies that are hosted here, I didn not create any of them myself, and you should probably get them from official sources instead. They're only provided here for convenience.

First step in modding the game is getting the game files, obviously. You can obtain these legally by purchasing the game digitally from Microsoft or getting a second hand disc version. You will then be able to fairly easily move the game files to your PC. This can be done either by copying the game files from your Xbox 360 to a USB stick, taking the Xbox 360 hard drive and reading the files off of it on your PC, or by simply downloading it directly from the Xbox Marketplace on your PC. If you don't own an Xbox 360 I strongly advise getting the digital version rather than disc, but if you already own a 360 getting the game from the disc is pretty straightforward as well.

For the digital version, the download link is:

http://download.xboxlive.com/content/4b4e07d1/f942257d9a6a6dcf2630fb93895880019b17e0d7.xcp

Note: it will only work if you own the game on Xbox Marketplace and are signed in to your Microsoft account.

Once you obtain the xcp you can convert it to GOD format using a tool called "XBL Marketplace for PC", again this will only work if you bought the game and downloaded a legit xcp yourself.

If you're copying the game from your Xbox 360 it will already be in GOD format.

Once you have the game in GOD format you will need to unpack it. 

The easiest way to unpack the game is to use Xenia canary File/Install option. This will put the unpacked game files in your Documents/Xenia/content folder.
