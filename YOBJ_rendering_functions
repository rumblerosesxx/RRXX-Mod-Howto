The following is a list of rendering functions that are commonly found in the YOBJ and used to apply various rendering effects, along with what parameters they take.
Each function name is 12 bytes long, then next 4 bytes are perhaps the encoding for the argument list (mayby length and type?) though that is also encoded in the
function names, and is then followed by the arguments themselves which vary in length depending on the function.

MatAmbCol (Material Ambient Color):

    Type: Vector (4 float values) representing RGBA.

MatDifCol (Material Diffuse Color):

    Type: Vector (4 float values) representing RGBA.

SpecularCol (Specular Color):

    Type: Vector (4 float values) representing RGBA, used for shiny reflections.

SpecularLev (Specular Level):

    Type: Float value, controlling the intensity of specular reflections.
    Example: 1.0 for normal intensity, 2.0 for exaggerated highlights.

SpecularPow (Specular Power):

    Type: Float value, often large (e.g., 10.0 to 100.0) to define the sharpness of the specular highlight.
    Example: 32.0 for a focused specular highlight.

HDRAlpha:

    Type: Float value, controlling the transparency or blending under HDR conditions.
    Example: 0.5 for 50% alpha in HDR rendering.

RefRegMap (Reflection Region Map):

    Type: Texture reference, may be pointing to a specific reflection map (cubemap, spherical map, etc.).

ReflectAdd (Reflection Additive):

    Type: Float value, controlling how strongly the reflection is added to the material.
    Example: 1.0 for normal reflection, 0.5 for blending.

ReflectAlpha (Reflection Alpha):

    Type: Float value, controlling the alpha transparency of the reflection.
    Example: 0.5 for semi-transparent reflection.

texDiffuse (Diffuse Texture):

    Type: Texture reference, pointing to the index in the texture array.

texSpecularMap (Specular Map Texture):

    Type: Texture reference, pointing to the specular map.

texNormal (Normal Map Texture):

    Type: Texture reference, pointing to the normal map.

texSphRefction (Spherical Reflection Map Texture):

    Type: Texture reference, pointing to a spherical reflection map (typically an environment map).

texRefctionReg (Reflection Region Map Texture):

    Type: Texture reference, pointing to the reflection region map.
